# Lingo Dogo — PRD

Personal, single-user, localhost, no auth. A **composable prompt-pack builder** for
language-practice sessions run elsewhere as a real-time voice conversation with an
AI "dojo master". Lingo Dogo does not do the voice session. It organizes the
instruction material, lets you pick and combine it, and hands you one markdown
prompt to paste into whatever voice tool you use.

Decided 2026-10-19 in the intake interview (all answers below are final for v1):

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| Content store | Markdown + YAML frontmatter files under `content/`; git is the history; **no database** |
| Embedded agent | Headless `claude -p` subprocess (sibling pattern) with Read on the repo and **Write/Edit scoped to `content/`**; every agent change is auto-committed so it can be reverted |
| Export | One self-contained markdown prompt; Copy button and a file written to `exports/` |
| Stack | Match Atlas (`../travel-guide`): React 19 + Vite + TS strict, Vite middleware API, Tailwind 4, oxlint, `node --test`; Dock app from `macos/`; **port 38400** |
| Unit model | **Slots with cardinality** declared in `content/schema.yaml`; units declare their slot; assembly walks slots in schema order |
| Learner profile | Global `content/profile.yaml` with per-pack overrides |
| Packs | Saved as `content/packs/<date>-<slug>.yaml`; seed library in Spanish (Oaxaca scenarios) |
| Voice target | Undecided; export is tool-agnostic markdown with a length readout |

## Vocabulary

- **Unit** — one composable instruction block (a `.md` file). Example: "Gentle in-line
  corrections", "Warm-up: ten useful phrases", "Guidance in the target language".
- **Slot** — a named position in the assembled prompt with a cardinality (`one` or
  `any`). Example slots: intro, warmup, difficulty, guidance-language, corrections,
  interrupts, debrief.
- **Scenario** — the setting and story for the session (a `.md` file). Example:
  "A palenque outside Santiago Matatlán: tasting mezcal with the maestro".
- **Profile** — who the learner is: native language, target language and variant,
  level, goals.
- **Pack** — one concrete selection: a scenario (or a free-text quick scenario),
  one or more units per slot, profile overrides, free notes. Saved as YAML.
- **Export** — the assembled markdown prompt rendered from a pack.
- **Dojo master** — the voice agent that receives the prompt. Lingo Dogo never
  talks to it.

## User flow (v1)

1. Open the app (Dock icon or `npm run dev`, http://localhost:38400).
2. Pick a scenario from the library, or type a quick scenario in a text box.
3. For each slot, choose units (radio for `one`, checkboxes for `any`). Defaults
   come pre-selected from each unit's `default: true`.
4. Optionally override target language / level for this pack and add free notes.
5. Watch the assembled prompt update live in the preview pane, with a word count.
6. Copy to clipboard, or Export to `exports/<date>-<slug>.md`, or Save the pack
   to reopen later. Saved packs appear in a list and can be loaded and cloned.
7. Ask the embedded agent to add or revise units/scenarios ("add a corrections
   unit that only flags gender agreement"). The agent edits files under `content/`;
   the app reloads content on the next request; the change is a git commit.

## Non-goals (v1)

- Running the voice session, transcripts, or a feedback loop from the session.
- In-app rich editing of unit bodies (agent or editor does that; follow-up bead).
- JSON bundle export for a programmatic voice pipeline (follow-up bead).
- Mimir/Obsidian export (follow-up bead).
- Multi-user, auth, deployment.

## Architecture

```
content/               the product: schema, units, scenarios, profile, packs (git-tracked)
scripts/
  content.mjs          load + validate content from disk (pure, no server deps)
  assemble.mjs         pack + content -> markdown (pure, tested)
  claude.mjs           spawn headless claude for the embedded agent (sibling pattern)
  export.mjs           CLI: node scripts/export.mjs content/packs/x.yaml
  tests/*.test.mjs     node --test
web/                   Vite app; API is Vite serve-middleware in web/server/*.ts
  server/api.ts        plugins + wrap() same-origin guard (copy Atlas)
  server/content.ts    GET /api/content, packs CRUD, POST /api/assemble, POST /api/export
  server/chat.ts       SSE chat with the embedded agent, auto-commit after edits
  shared/wire.ts       types shared by server and client
  src/                 React UI
exports/               rendered prompts (gitignored)
data/                  runtime state: chat history, settings (gitignored)
macos/                 Dock app (Lingo Dogo.app), copied from Atlas, port 38400
docs/                  this PRD, CONTENT.md (file format contract)
```

See `docs/CONTENT.md` for the exact file formats and the assembly algorithm. That
document is the contract between the content library, the loader, and the UI.
