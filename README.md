# Lingo Dojo

A composable prompt-pack builder for spoken language practice. You pick a scenario
("tasting mezcal at a palenque outside Santiago Matatlán"), choose the lesson units
you want (how the session opens, warm-up drills, how hard it pushes you, which
language the guidance comes in, how mistakes are corrected, how it closes), and get
one markdown prompt to paste into whatever voice agent you talk to. The voice agent
is the **dojo master**; Lingo Dojo never runs the session itself.

Three ideas, one app:

1. **Everything is a text file.** Units, scenarios, your learner profile, and saved
   packs are markdown and YAML under `content/`. Git is the history. There is no
   database.
2. **Slots, not a pile of toggles.** `content/schema.yaml` names the slots in prompt
   order and says whether each is pick-one or pick-any. The UI is one card per slot.
3. **An agent that edits the library.** The chat drawer runs a headless Claude that
   may read the repo but can only write under `content/`. Every edit it makes is a
   git commit, so you can always revert.

## Running

```sh
npm install && npm --prefix web install   # once
npm run dev                               # http://localhost:38400
```

Or build the Dock app once and launch it by icon (see `macos/README.md`; the first
launch asks for Documents access for "Lingo Dojo Server"):

```sh
./macos/build-app.sh
open -a "Lingo Dojo"
```

The embedded agent uses your Claude Code login. No API key is involved.

## Using it

- **Left column**: pick a scenario or type a quick one; override the target language,
  variant, or level for this pack; add free notes for the dojo master.
- **Middle**: one card per slot. Radios for pick-one slots, checkboxes for pick-any.
  Units marked `default: true` start selected.
- **Right**: the assembled prompt, live, with warnings and a word/token readout.
  **Copy** puts it on the clipboard. **Export** writes `exports/<id>.md`. **Save**
  stores the pack as `content/packs/<date>-<slug>.yaml`; saved packs can be loaded
  or cloned.
- **Agent drawer** (right edge): ask for new or revised units and scenarios in plain
  language ("add a corrections unit that only flags gender agreement"). New files
  appear in the slots as soon as the commit lands.

Command line export of a saved pack:

```sh
npm run export -- content/packs/2026-10-19-palenque-first-visit.yaml
```

## Modes

There are two libraries, switched from the Profile pill in the top bar. **Adult**
is `content/`: conversation practice at a CEFR level. **Kids** is `content/kids/`:
story, play and short sessions for a child who does not read yet, with its own
slots (opening, helper character, story shape, repetition games, energy and
length), its own frame, profile, scenarios and packs, and a child-sized level
scale. The two never mix: a kids pack lives in `content/kids/packs/`, a kids
export in `exports/kids/`, and the agent is told which library you are looking
at. Each mode remembers its own draft, tab and filters in the browser.

## Authoring content

`docs/CONTENT.md` is the contract: file layout, required frontmatter, placeholders
(`{{learner_name}}`, `{{target_language}}`, ...), and the assembly algorithm. Unit
bodies are written as second-person instructions to the dojo master and must be
self-contained. The seed library is Mexican Spanish with Oaxaca scenarios; add a
scenario file for any other setting or language, and change `content/profile.yaml`
for a different target language.

## Architecture

```
content/        the product: schema, frame, profile, units, scenarios, packs
scripts/        content.mjs (loader), assemble.mjs (pack -> markdown), export.mjs (CLI),
                claude.mjs (headless agent spawn), tests/ (node --test)
web/server/     Vite serve-middleware API behind a same-origin wrap():
                /api/content, /api/packs[/:id], /api/assemble, /api/export,
                /api/chat (SSE), /api/chat/history, /api/settings
web/src/        React UI: ScenarioColumn, SlotsColumn, PreviewColumn, AgentDrawer/ChatPanel
data/           runtime state (chat history, model setting), gitignored
exports/        rendered prompts, gitignored
macos/          Dock app (stay-open applet + server helper), port 38400
docs/           PRD.md (decisions), CONTENT.md (format contract)
```

Stack: React 19, Vite, TypeScript strict, Tailwind 4, oxlint, Node's built-in test
runner. Same conventions as the sibling apps Atlas, Wine Guide, and Basecamp.

## Checks

```sh
npm test                       # loader, assembler, export CLI, API, agent argv
npm --prefix web run lint      # oxlint
(cd web && npx tsc -b)         # types
```

Work is tracked with beads (`bd ready`, prefix `ld`).
