# 3b. helper app: "Lingo Dogo Server.app" — a faceless bundle that keeps the dev
# server as its child. Its executable is a COMPILED shim (server-shim.c) that
# execs server-runner.sh from Resources. History of this shape, because it
# has now inverted twice: pre-26.6.2, the script-as-executable bundle was the
# one whose Documents grant stuck and a compiled applet was silently denied;
# macOS 26.6.2 flipped it — a script executable runs as /bin/zsh (a platform
# binary tccd will neither prompt for nor match a grant to), so the helper
# was denied silently and even a Full Disk Access row didn't take. A real
# Mach-O gives tccd a promptable identity again (measured 2026-08-29).
