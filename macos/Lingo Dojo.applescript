-- Lingo Dojo launcher: a stay-open Dock app wrapping the lingo-dojo dev server.
--
-- Why this shape (lifted from wine-guide's Wine Guide.app, itself from
-- trail-train's Basecamp.app): Lingo Dojo is not a static site — research, chat
-- and the bulk queue are Vite dev-server middleware that spawn node and the
-- `claude` CLI, so "the app" IS the dev server plus a browser tab. This
-- applet gives that server real app semantics: launch by icon, a Dock
-- presence while it runs, reopen-to-focus, and Quit stops the server (only
-- if this app started it — see startedByMe).
--
-- Why a helper app runs the actual server (two hard-won macOS facts):
--   1. TCC attribution does not survive orphaning — a nohup/disown'd server
--      is reparented to launchd, loses its launcher's Documents grant, and
--      dies with a silent EPERM (the repo lives under ~/Documents).
--   2. The helper must be its own app bundle, and its executable must be a
--      real compiled binary (macos/server-shim.c, which execs the runner
--      script). macOS 26.6.2 stopped attributing TCC to script-executable
--      bundles — the process is /bin/zsh, which tccd will neither prompt for
--      nor match a Full Disk Access row against — so a script helper is
--      denied silently and no new grant can be established. Before that
--      update the opposite was true; see macos/README.md.
-- So the server runs as the BLOCKING child of "Lingo Dojo Server.app", a faceless
-- helper bundle that stays alive exactly as long as the server does. This
-- applet is the Dock face: Quit pkills vite, which unwinds npm → helper.
--
-- The server runs on the FIXED port below (strictPort in web/vite.config.ts),
-- so health checks and the app URL are deterministic.
-- Built and installed by macos/build-app.sh (osacompile -s for stay-open),
-- which substitutes __LINGODOJO_REPO__ with the checkout it was built from.

property dashUrl : "http://localhost:38400"
-- ($| ) not $: still matches a vite launched with arguments (--host), while
-- excluding `vite build` / `vite preview` whose first arg is a subcommand.
-- Anchored on THIS checkout's path so a worktree's server is never matched.
property killPattern : "__LINGODOJO_REPO__/web/node_modules/.bin/vite($| --)"
property wasUp : false
-- Quit must not kill a server this app merely ADOPTED (a manual `npm run
-- dev`, a worktree's server) — only one it launched itself.
property startedByMe : false
-- One failed health check is not death: editing any server file restarts
-- Vite (the config imports the whole server tree), leaving the port unbound
-- for a few hundred ms. Require several consecutive misses before believing
-- the server is gone.
