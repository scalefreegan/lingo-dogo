# Lingo Dojo.app

A stay-open Dock app wrapping the lingo-dojo dev server — the pattern
worked out for trail-train's Basecamp.app and hardened in wine-guide's Wine
Guide.app (PR #7), copied here. Launch by icon, Lingo Dojo opens in the browser at
the fixed port, quitting the Dock icon stops the server (if the app started
it).

```sh
./macos/build-app.sh     # builds and installs /Applications/Lingo Dojo.app
open -a Lingo Dojo
```

## Anatomy

- **`Lingo Dojo.applescript`** — the Dock face. Stay-open applet: `run`/`reopen`
  start the server (if down) and open http://localhost:38400; `idle` quits
  the Dock icon after **three consecutive** failed health checks (one miss is
  normal — editing any server file restarts Vite, unbinding the port for a
  moment); `quit` pkills vite **only if this app started it** — a server it
  merely adopted (your manual `npm run dev`, a worktree's) is left alone.
  The health check fetches `/` and requires Lingo Dojo's own `<title>`, so a
  stranger on the port is never mistaken for the app.
- **`server-shim.c`** — compiled by `build-app.sh` into
  `Contents/MacOS/LingoDojoServer`, the executable of the nested, faceless
  **Lingo Dojo Server.app** (`Contents/Helpers/`). All it does is `exec` the
  runner script from `Contents/Resources/`. **A working `clang` is a build
  prerequisite.**
- **`server-runner.sh`** — the runner itself, living in
  `Contents/Resources/`. It runs `npm --prefix web run dev` from the repo
  root as its blocking child.

  Two macOS facts force this shape. First, a TCC ~/Documents grant does not
  survive orphaning to launchd: a `nohup`/`disown`'d server is reparented,
  loses its launcher's grant, and dies with a silent EPERM.

  Second — and this one **inverted on 2026-08-29** — the helper's executable
  must be a real Mach-O binary. Before macOS 26.6.2 a plain shell script was
  the shape whose grant stuck, and a compiled variant was silently denied;
  the update reversed it. A script-executable bundle now runs as `/bin/zsh`,
  a platform binary `tccd` will neither prompt for nor match a Full Disk
  Access row against, so no *new* grant can ever be established: silent
  denial, no prompt, and an FDA entry that does nothing. Existing grants were
  honoured, which is why this surfaced only when one was reset. The shim
  restores a promptable identity. If you are reading this after another macOS
  release, re-measure before trusting either direction.
- **`icon.svg`** — icon source (a gold torii gate against a red sun with a white
  speech bubble between the pillars; gold `#f2b949`, red `#b8322b`, cream
  `#f5f1e8` on indigo `#1b1f3a`). `render-icon.sh`
  rasterizes it to `icon-1024.png` with `sips` (which reads SVG and keeps the
  transparent corners — no Pillow or browser needed); `build-app.sh` derives
  the `.icns` ladder from the PNG. No SVG filters: `sips` renders through
  CoreGraphics' basic SVG support, so everything is flat fills.
- The app itself is a build product, not committed; `build-app.sh` is the
  source of truth. Rebuild after changing any of its four inputs —
  `Lingo Dojo.applescript`, `server-shim.c`, `server-runner.sh` or the icon.
  Needs `clang` for the shim. A rebuild changes the helper's code identity,
  which invalidates its TCC grant: if the server then won't start, run
  `tccutil reset All com.scalefreegan.lingodojo.server` and relaunch to get a
  fresh prompt.

## Repo path

Nothing is hardcoded to this machine: `build-app.sh` takes the checkout it
lives in (`macos/..`) and bakes that path into the applet's kill pattern and
the runner's `cd` when it builds. Move or clone the repo, rebuild, and the
launcher follows. Running `macos/server-runner.sh` by hand from the repo
works too — it falls back to its own location when the path isn't baked in.

## First launch — and after every rebuild

macOS may show one Documents-access prompt attributed to "Lingo Dojo Server" —
approve it, or the server dies with EPERM (the runner logs the guidance).
**Every rebuild re-signs the bundles ad hoc, which changes their code
identity (cdhash) — the old TCC grant stops applying and macOS may deny
WITHOUT re-prompting.** Recovery, in order:
1. `tccutil reset SystemPolicyDocumentsFolder com.scalefreegan.lingodojo.server`
   (and the same for `com.scalefreegan.lingodojo`), then relaunch — this clears
   the stale record so a fresh prompt can appear.
2. If still no prompt: System Settings → Privacy & Security → **Full Disk
   Access** → "+" → add
   `/Applications/Lingo Dojo.app/Contents/Helpers/Lingo Dojo Server.app`, then relaunch.

Server log: `~/Library/Logs/LingoDojo.log` (the previous run is kept at
`.log.old`).

The app expects `npm install` to have been run once (repo root and `web/`) —
the launcher starts the server, it doesn't install dependencies.

## Port

`web/vite.config.ts` pins the dev server to **38400** (`strictPort`), so the
app's health check and URL are deterministic (Atlas is 38300, Wine Guide 38200, Basecamp
38100; all four can run at once). `npm run dev` by hand uses the same port:
if the app is running, the manual server fails loudly (by design); if the
manual server is running first, the app **adopts** it — and Quit then leaves
it running, since the app doesn't kill what it didn't start. The same applies
to a server that outlives the 30s startup window: the launcher relinquishes
ownership (so it can't kill a still-warming server), later clicks adopt it,
and Quit leaves it — `pkill -f 'lingo-dojo/web.*vite'` by hand if you ever
need it gone.

## Caveats

The bundle id is personal (`com.scalefreegan.lingodojo`) and signing is ad hoc.
This is a personal launcher, not a distributable app.
